<p><strong>Hierarchical Database Model</strong></p>
<p>A hierarchical  database organizes the data much like a family tree ordering, which represents  information using a parent/child relationship paradigm: each parent can have many children,  but each child has only one parent (also known as a 1-to-many relationship).</p>

<p>All attributes of a specific record  are listed  under an entity type. In a database,  an entity type is the equivalent of a table. Each individual record is  represented as a row, and each attribute is represented as a column. Entity  types are related to each other using 1:N mappings, also known as one-to-many  relationships.</p>

<p>This model is recognized as the first database  model created by IBM in the 1960s. Currently the most widely used hierarchical databases  are IMS, developed by IBM, and Windows Registry, by Microsoft.</p>
