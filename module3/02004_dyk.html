<p><strong>According to an article by Alice Lipowicz</strong><br />
  <strong>(August 27, 2010):</strong></p>
<p>MUMPS is here to stay as the  computer language for the Veterans Affairs Department&rsquo;s electronic health  record system â€” at least for the immediate future, said Roger Baker, VA&rsquo;s  assistant secretary for information and technology.</p>
<p>Addressing a longstanding debate,  Baker said on Aug. 26 he favors preserving the Massachusetts General Hospital  Utility Multi-Programming System computer language for the Veterans Health  Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) while officials pursue  efforts to modernize VistA.</p>
<p>VistA was developed more than two decades  ago in the MUMPS programming language and has since been expanded to cover  millions of lines of computer code. MUMPS will remain at the core of VistA even  as VA officials consider opportunities  to modernize VistA through an  open-source  software development project, Baker  told Federal Computer Week in an e-mailed statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s because I have a  background in computer languages, but I just don&rsquo;t think MUMPS is much of an  issue related to the open-source VistA discussion,&rdquo; Baker said. &ldquo;There are over  15 million lines of MUMPS code in VistA, so I just don&rsquo;t see us deciding to  recode all of that in another language right away,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>VA officials have been concerned  about how well modules written in other  computer languages would interface with MUMPS code, but Baker said those  concerns have been resolved. &ldquo;Lots of folks have weighed in to assure me that  it is not a significant issue,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So I would expect an open-source  VistA system to evolve over time as people choose the language they prefer to write  new functionality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>VA has been pursuing options for modernizing  VistA for more than a year. Baker asked an Industry Advisory Council working  group to offer advice, and the group recommended in May that VA use an open-source  development program to  update VistA.</p>
