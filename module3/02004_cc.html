<p>M has several characteristics that  can confound first-time programmers. Here are some things to keep in mind as  you are working in this environment: </p>
<ul>
  <li>M is its  own database, but its database is not SQL. It is a hierarchical database that  is ideally suited to healthcare.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>M often  behaves like an operating system. Because of space limitations, some original  implementations of M actually were the operating systems on the machine. This  legacy still influences the behavior of M.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Global  variables mean something specific in the permanent database. That is, they are global  across all processes in the system and not global in the typical programming  meaning of global across all the subparts of a single program. Variables that  are shared within all parts of a single program are called local variables in M.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>M is not a  C-based syntax, as most modern programming languages are. This means that M  code looks strange to outsiders.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>M is not  white-space invariant. This means that you must pay attention to where you put  spaces. Many modern program languages allow you to insert spaces at any point  (following FORTRAN rules originally).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>With M, you  must be careful where you indent using spaces. Putting multiple spaces in some  places is not permitted.</li>
</ul>
