<p><strong><em>BusinessWeek</em>—Article Title: THE  BEST MEDICAL CARE IN THE U.S.</strong></p>
<p>(How Veterans Affairs transformed itself – and what it means for the  rest of us). The centerpiece of that culture is VistA, the VA&rsquo;s much praised electronic  medical-records system. Every office visit, prescription, and medical procedure  is recorded in its database, allowing doctors and nurses to update themselves  on a patient&rsquo;s status with just a few keystrokes. In 1995, patient records at  VA hospitals were available at the time of a clinical encounter only 60% of the  time. Today they are 100% available. Some 96% of all prescriptions and medical  orders, such as lab tests, are now entered electronically. The national comparison  is more like 8%. &ldquo;One out of five tests in a civilian hospital have to be  repeated because the paper results are lost,&rdquo; says Veterans Affairs Secretary  R. James Nicholson. &ldquo;That's not happening in our hospitals.&rdquo; VistA is a big  reason why the VA has held its costs per patient steady over the past 10 years  despite double-digit inflation in health-care prices.  <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_29/b3993061.htm" target="_blank">http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_29/b3993061.htm</a></p>
