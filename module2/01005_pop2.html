<p><strong><em>NextGov</em>—Article Title: VA’S  HEALTH RECORD SYSTEM CITED AS MODEL FOR NATIONAL NETWORK</strong></p>
<p>Shinseki  told the hearing VistA has provided VA with significant savings. He said  between 1997 and 2007 VA invested $4 billion in health information technology  but an independent study showed during the same period this investment yielded  more than $7 billion in savings. &ldquo;More than 86 percent of the savings were due  to the elimination of duplicated  tests and reduced medical errors,&quot; Shinseki said. <a href="http://www.nextgov.com/nextgov/ng_20110217_9686.php" target="_blank">http://www.nextgov.com/nextgov/ng_20110217_9686.php</a></p>
