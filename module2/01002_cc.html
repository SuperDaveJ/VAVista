<p>To begin, VistA stands for Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture.</p> 

<p>As advances continue in inter-facility networking, data sharing, and specialized central support and technical tools, VistA is a single, highly scalable national Health Information System solution.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, VistA is an integrated system of software applications that directly supports patient care at Veterans Health Administration, or VHA, healthcare facilities.</p>

<p>It operates under the auspices of the VA Office of Information Technology. VistA connects VHA facility workstations and PCs with nationally mandated and locally adapted software applications.</p> 

<p>Some end users access these applications through a graphical user interface known as the Computerized Patient Record System â€“ or CPRS.</p>
