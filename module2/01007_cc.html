<p>Developers working on VistA are expected to follow programming standards and conventions established by the
VA VistA Standards and Conventions Committee (SACC).</p> 

<p>This will ensure that the software continues to run properly on later versions of the underlying M and other operating systems and allow for the migration to a new host operating system or environment.</p> 

<p>Developers new to VA typically come from other programming backgrounds and have no VistA experience. VA gives VistA and M training in the form of multi-day instructor led workshops and web-based trainings such as this one.</p>
